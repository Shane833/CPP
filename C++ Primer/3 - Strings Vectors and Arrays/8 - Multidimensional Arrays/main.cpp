    // getting the address to the first element of the array
   std::cout << *p << std::endl; // should get 1

   		// Alright so I was right it was a Pointer to int
   		for(auto y : x){ // Now what should be the type of y? pointer to pointer to int ?? 
   			std::cout << typeid(y).name() << std::endl;

   int (*ptr)[3] = arr; // points to an array of ints of dimensions 3
   ptr++; // now this will be incremented by the size of the array
   		// and will now point to the second array if it exist

   //auto ptr = arr;
   int * q = *ptr; // since this will return an array, we can point to the first element
   //std::cout << typeid(ptr).name() << std::endl;
   std::cout << *q << std::endl; // should print 4

   // We can also use library begin and end or simple for loops with auto
   for(auto p = std::begin(arr);p != std::end(arr);p++){
   	for(auto q = std::begin(*p);q != std::end(*p);q++){
   		std::cout << *q << std::endl;

   // This would mean that (Alright I'll come back to it later)
   int[3] * ptrs = arr; // is also valid ??
